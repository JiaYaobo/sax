# High Performance Stats Models in JAX

A modern statistics package based on JAX, inspired by sklearn, statsmodels and tidymodels etc.

==============================================================

I'd like to build a pure functional stats tools, class should act like function, function is everything, data feeds the function, and data comes from function. 

==============================================================

If u're interested in statistics and functional programming or jax, 
we can build stamox together !!!
